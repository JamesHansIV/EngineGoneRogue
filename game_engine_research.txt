A game engine is a software development environment designed specifically for creating video games. The main components of a game engine include a rendering engine, input systems, physics engine, AI systems and audio engine. The rendering engine handles all the graphics and visuals in the game by displaying 3D models, animations, levels and environments on the screen. The input systems allow players to control characters and objects using input devices like keyboards, mice, controllers etc. Physics engines are used to simulate physically accurate environments like gravity, collisions and player movements.  Together these different components of a game engine greatly help game developers in creating interactive game worlds and mechanics. They allow the developers to focus on gameplay design rather than programming low level code. This makes development process faster and easier for creating exciting and immersive gaming experiences.
