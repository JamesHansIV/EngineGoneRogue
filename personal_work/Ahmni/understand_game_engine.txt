The core functionality for a game engine include having a rendering engine, a physics engine and/or collission detection, sound, scripting,
animation, artificial intelligence, networking, streaming, memory management, threading, scene, and video support. A rendering engine controls how
all graphics are displayed to the user. A physics engine controls the physics of the game. Scripting allows for the user of the game engine to
code their own game mechanics. Scene allows users to create maps, graphics and GUI easily, normally through a graph structure. Artificial intelligence
is how the Non-playable characters or NPCs function, and are edited by the user. Essentially, a game engine is an abstraction for the user using the game
engine, so that they can spend more time creating their game instead of worrying about these lower level technical issues.
