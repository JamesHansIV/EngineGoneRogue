While a lot of game engines, such as Unity and Unreal engine, are developed to target all games regardless of genre or type,
most game engines are created to cater to smaller subgroups of games. In fact, a large majority of games are developed with
in-house engines that are built specifically for the game. This allows for lighter builds that don't contain uneeded
functionality. It also enables unique designs that don't fit inside the mold of the typical game. Noita, for example,
simulates every pixel in its physics environment, which means that each pixel can be burned, exploded, or melted. This
feature required a proprietary engine that provided a physics system to accomodate it. Our team has similar motives with
our own project. We want to build an engine that specializes in a specific game genre so that we build only the essential
components. Each component will also be implemented with the knowledge that they won't accomplish all of the functions
seen in general purpose game engines. If we have time, we will also consider providing functionality to enable a unique
feature unseen in most games.
