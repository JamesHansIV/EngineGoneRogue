(~ = in progress)

x consider managing projectiles with projectile manager
x the character class should own the health property
x managing health should be done by the health class
- enemy objects should be handled by an enemy manager
- remove hard coded animations/health bars/weapons
- add enemy types
x enemies are able to slip through walls somehow

editor stuff
- resizable main window
x switch edit mode from keybinds (decouple edit mode from gui, so we can change the gui to new layout)
~ Visual indicator for edit mode
    - Text
    ~ Cursor
- Erase tool should not have to collide with with the texture game object to delete the texture. 
  The collider should be the tile. This would make the "paint-erase" easier to use. Current implementation
  often requires multiple passes to delete everything.
- adjustable window size
- resolution handling
~ vertical toolbar (left) 
- create multiselect tool 
  - select
  - copy
  - paste
  - delete
- save scenes (to be loaded into game application)

(would be cool)
